- This repository contains only a Hero Section to enhance my skills using HTML and CSS, also being able to practice my usage of Git and GitHub. 

- The figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/u4lN4AS0qzxkjXyQGwUgss/EquipAble?t=pF8jsWWiqwsh5494-1

- The image from the right that contains some boxes and rectangle, I use it to visualize the columns and rows of this Landing Page.

- I provided some side comments especially to the CSS section, just so I can familiarize what's the use of that element.
  
- Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and connect with me on GitHub!
