This repository contains a Landing Page for Disability Second Hand Equipment, it contains only a Hero Section to enhance my skills using HTML and CSS, also being able to practice my usage of Git and GitHub. 
I provided some side comments especially to the CSS section, just so I can familiarize what's the use of that element.
Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and connect with me on GitHub!
